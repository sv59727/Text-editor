# Text-editor
In my second project i have made a text editor. The project is about to design a simple text editor using  the common feature of java and frameworks. The text editor can edit 
almost any type of format like .txt, .html etc. Easy to use implementation of shortcut keys for basic editing function. This project is designing over java common features . 
There are three item in menubar File , edit and help. In file we have many option like New, open, save , print and exit and in edit section we have cut, copy, paste and select
all. In last item of menubar is for about section. So simplify the use of text editor of windows in OS with ease. The main objective of this project is to edit or update the text.

Concept used -> Swing and file handling

File handling -> File handling in Java is defined as reading and writing data to a file. ... Thus, if we want to use a file class, we need to create an object of that particular class and should specify the filename or directory name.

Swing -> Swing is used for graphical user interface (GUI)
Swing is a GUI widget toolkit for Java. It is part of Oracle's Java Foundation Classes â€“ an API for providing a graphical user interface for Java programs. Swing was developed to provide a more sophisticated set of GUI components than the earlier Abstract Window Toolkit. 

Firstly we extends JFrame class that is in Java.swing.*;

In starting we make object ,after just the constructor is call we get to see the frame.
